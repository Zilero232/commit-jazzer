## 🔍 Description

**`commit-jazzer`** is a tool that introduces a touch of musical flair into your Git commit messages. Built on the solid foundation of Commitizen, it allows you to follow commit conventions and spice up your messages with emojis. Instead of just typing standard commit texts, you'll choose commit types, write descriptions, and—just like in jazz—improvise to create a symphony of commits.

🎷 **Jazz your commits**: It's not just about structure—it's about creativity. Transform your commits into something dynamic, creative, and fun!

## ⚡ Features

- 🎶 **Musical Commit Messages**: Format your commits with delightful emojis like 🎸, 🐛, 💄, and more.
- ⚡ **Quick Setup**: Easy installation and integration into your project.
- 🎼 **Predefined Commit Types**: Choose from predefined types and descriptions to maintain consistency.
- 🛠 **Bad Word Handling**: Automatically handles undesirable words in commit messages and helps you avoid inappropriate expressions.
- 🔧 **Flexible Configuration**: Customize commit templates and type schemes for a personal touch.

## 💻 Installation and Usage

### Globally

Install `commitizen` globally, if you have not already.

```sh
npm install commitizen -g
```

Install your preferred `commitizen` adapter globally (for example [`commit-jazzer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commit-jazzer)).

```sh
npm install commit-jazzer -g
```

Create a `.czrc` file in your `home` directory, with `path` referring to the preferred, globally-installed, `commitizen` adapter

```sh
echo '{ "path": "cz-conventional-changelog" }' > ~/.czrc
```

You are all set! Now `cd` into any `git` repository and use `git cz` and you will find the `commit-jazzer` prompt.

### Locally

To install `commit-jazzer` as a development dependency, run::

```bash
npm install --save-dev commit-jazzer
```

Then, add this configuration to your `package.json`:

```json
"config": {
  "commitizen": {
    "path": "commit-jazzer"
  }
}
```

After installation, simply run:

```bash
git cz
```
